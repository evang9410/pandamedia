- On the manager page, if you try to perform any actions with the buttons you have to double click them. A single click does not work. Please help

- If you the following error when compiling with testing turned on, start the GlassFish server:

Helpful hints:
In your Shared With me folder in Google drive you can find the resources for the project.
This is just a simple read me that should be updated with the projects specifications and stuff.
